1/30/2024 - Group met up and did initial discussion on how to build the overall circuit, tried to use ultrasonic sensor board with the ESP and tested range. I worked on looking at the specs of various components and summing up power requirements.

2/4/2024 - Project proposal work as a group, completed team contract. Created visual aid and requirements list, with specific power requirements of all components.

2/13/2024 - Unable to attend TA meeting, talked with group later on about the things that needed to be changed for the project proposal

2/14/2024 - Group met up to talk about changes needed for the project proposal, changed visual aid and talked about new requirements for simplifying high level requirements and R/V tables.

2/16/2024 - Made initial version of schematic for the tag. Took portions of ESP32 example circuit needed from website (programming circuit) and added connectors for the sensors on the trash tag.

2/18/2024 - Completed the modified visual aid, added R/V tables with concrete numbers to project proposal

2/20/2024 - Met with TA to discuss the corrected Project Proposal, made suggested changes (adding numbers to requirements side of R/V tables) and submitted new Project Proposal

2/21/2024 - Added custom footprints, footprint assignemnts to schematic. Corrected schematic symbols with N.C. connections. Created V1 of the Sensor Tag layout

2/24/2024 - Created V2 of the sensor tag layout, passed pcbway trial. Discussed with group the parts available for powering the board (micro usb from lab)
