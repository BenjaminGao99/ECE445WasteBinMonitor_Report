1/30/2024 - Met as a group to discuss project proposal and begin building Ultrasonic Sensor. We did some research and tried to figure out how an ultrasonic senor works. We also tested a working ultrasonic sensor with our ESP32 to make sure it had the capabilites to do so.

2/4/2024 - Met as a group to work on project proposal. Also completed our team contract. I did some research on our screen and realized that there may be an issue with 3.3-5v TX and Rx connections between the ESP32 and Screen. I plan on buying the screen to test it out and I will check on its viability later.

Met with TA
Spoke about Design document. Looked through parts list to order components. Talked over changes that need to be made to the proposal including.
Make High level requirements list more concise.
Dumb down the visual aid
Change block diagram (add stuff to arrows), make it smaller
Add R/V table to replace subsystem verification
Do tolerance Analysis for voltage regulator
Quote IEEE for rule 3 (maybe add OSHA for smell) what if someone throws water at it
Another thing someone could add is the weight of the bag (no more than 50 lbs). Look at sp23 team 21

Met with group to revise proposal. Added Temperature sensor to Breadboard circuit. Ironed out details for which sensors are 5v (ultrasonic) and which sensors were 3.3v (Temperature/Humidity and Gas Sensor). Worked on R/V tables and divided up work for the rest of the week to tackle the proposal changes.

2/16/2024
Made slight modifications to Breadboard circuit. Protected the ESP32 from Utrasonic 5v signals through a voltage divider. Decided to use My trash can for the final demo and that we will be using a board above the can to mount our sensor. We will use boxes to "fill up" the can during the demo.

2/19/2024
Worked on Proposal revisions and added them to Latex document. Revised Ethics and Safety section to fit the needs of the class. Decided to use a Housing for the sensor to protect it from splashing water and other debris when trash is thrown in the can.
