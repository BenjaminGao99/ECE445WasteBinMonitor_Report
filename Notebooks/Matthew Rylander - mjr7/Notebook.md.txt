2/4/2024 - Met as a group to work on project proposal. Also completed our team contract. I did some research on our screen and realized that there may be an issue with 3.3-5v TX and Rx connections between the ESP32 and Screen. I plan on buying the screen to test it out and I will check on its viability later.
